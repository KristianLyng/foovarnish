Varnish Foo is the ultimate `Varnish Cache`_ book out there. Or it will be,
when it's done.

The book is being written by `Kristian Lyngstøl`_, a long-time Varnish
hacker. It is being published one chapter at a time, and you can either read it
online at `varnishfoo.info`_ or `download a PDF`_.

This book is not done yet. The individual chapters are meant to stand well
on their own, but many chapters are yet to be written and the content is
likely to evolve over time.

Found something that should be fixed?

I am very interested in any and all feedback, from pure spelling mistakes
to factual errors or whether the book flows well or not.

The best way to get in contact with me is to jump over to `the github
repo`_ and report an issue. If that doesn't work for you, you can also drop
me a mail at kly@kly.no.

Current status
--------------

Chapter 1 through 3 stand well as they are, all though they might need some
updates here and there.

I am currently progressing through VCL.

Chapter 4, introduction to VCL, can be used as a reference as it is, but I
have not done a thorough review of it yet from a pedagogical point of view.
I expect some parts to require changes to be truly good.

Chapter 5 is currently being developed from scratch. Much has changed since
I was at my peak in the Varnish community, so I intend to update my own
knowledge throughout the development of that chapter (and further
chapters). I do have some really good bits in store for you all, though.

Basically: Read chapter 1 through 4 as "true", but don't assume chapter 5
represents current best practices until further notice.

Building
--------

I build this on Debian (stable and testing). It should build fine on other
distros too.

You will need, at least, "moreutils" (for ``sponge``), make, graphviz,
rst2pdf, rst2html (docutils), pygmentize (2.2 or newer), Varnish, and probably 
more (i.e. pip).
