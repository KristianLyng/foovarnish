Intelligent traffic routing
===========================

.. warning::

   I expect this chapter to change significantly throughout its creation, and
   possibly throughout the creation of the rest of the book. It should be
   seen in context with chapter 4, introduction to VCL.

   I advise against reviewing the pedagogical aspects of the chapter until
   the text is complete (as in: a summary exists). Or until this warning is
   removed.

   As of this writing, I have not done a thorough technical review of the
   details as they relate to Varnish 4.1 or newer. The principles explained
   should all be correct, but some constants and commands might have
   changed.

Now that we've looked at basic VCL, it's time to start talking about how to
direct traffic. While many Varnish installations only have a single
backend, all the big ones have numerous backend servers.

Varnish supports this quite well, and provides a small but powerful set of
tools that will allow you to direct traffic.

There are two terms that are at the core of this chapter. The backend
director, usually just called director, which is a collection of multiple
backend servers, and the health check probe.

Both directors and probes can be either very simple or quite elaborate.
We'll start off looking closely at probes, then move on to directors to tie
it together.

Two often overlooked features is the fact that directors are now dynamic -
you can add and remove (predefined) backends from regular VCL - and that
directors can be nested. We'll look at both these features and what they
offer you.

A closer look at a backend
--------------------------

We've looked at backends only briefly at backends so far. Only specifying
the host and port-options. But backends can have a few more options.


+-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Option                | Default    | Description                                          |
+=======================+============+======================================================+
| host                  |            | Mandatory host-name or IP of the backend.            |
|                       |            | Has to resolve to max 1 IPv4 address and 1 IPv6      |
|                       |            | address. In other words: Your backends can be        |
|                       |            | dual-stack (both IPv4/IPv6), but not load-balanced   |
|                       |            | with DNS round-robin.                                |
+-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| port                  | 80         | TCP port number to connect to.                       |
|                       |            |                                                      |
+-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| host_header           |            | Optional Host-header to add. This is mainly useful   |
|                       |            | for health probes, if the backend requires a         |
|                       |            | valid or specific Host-header.                       |
+-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| connect_timeout       | From       | Timeout waiting for the TCP connection to be         |
|                       | parameters | established. Should be low, as this is usually       |
|                       | (3.5s)     | handled by the operating system. Factors that are    |
|                       |            | relevant: Geographic distance, virtualization.       |
+-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| first_byte_timeout    | From       | Timeout waiting for the very first byte of a reply.  |
|                       | parameters | This is application-dependent. Typically, an         |
|                       | (60s)      | application will send the entire response in one go  |
|                       |            | after generating it, so this is basically            |
|                       |            | how long you expect/allow the application to generate|
|                       |            | a response.                                          |
+-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| between_bytes_timeout | From       | The timeout between individual read-operations after |
|                       | parameters | the backend has started sending data. Should rarely  |
|                       | (60s)      | be long, depending on the application. This is       |
|                       |            | essentially a means to detect stalled connections.   |
+-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| max_connections       | unlimited  | The maximum number of connections Varnish will open  |
|                       |            | to a given backend.                                  |
+-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| probe                 |            | Health check definition or reference.                |
|                       |            | Covered in detail in the next sub-chapter.           |
+-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+

All the timeout values default to whatever the matching parameters are set
to. The default values in parentheses is the default parameter value of
Varnish 4.1.

Over a number of years, the default values for various timeouts have been
tweaked frequently to adapt to what has proven to work. This is specially
true for ``connect_timeout``. Every once in a while you might run across
systems with greatly increased timeouts. A few questions you should ask
yourself:

1. How long would a user actually wait.
2. What are you *actually* waiting for.
3. In what circumstances would you want to send traffic to a backend this
   slow?

If you are working with actual users, a connect_timeout of 600s is just
pointless. First, the connection is usually established by the operating
system, which means that even if the application is heavily loaded, the
actual TCP connection would be fast. Secondly, none of your users will wait
for 10 minutes to get cat-pictures.

If the application is used by non-humans (e.g.: API interface), then
allowing slightly higher timeouts generally make sense.

At the end of the day, timeouts are there to avoid using up resources on
the Varnish-host waiting for backends that will never respond. By timing
out, you might be able to deliver stale content to a user (who would be
none the wiser) instead of waiting until the user leaves.

Health probes
-------------

A health check allows you to test that a backend is working as it should
before you start fetching resources from it. In its simplest form, it is
just a URL on a backend:

.. code:: VCL

   backend foo {
           .host = "192.168.0.1";
           .probe = {
                   .url = "/healthcheck";
           }
   }

This will set up a health check where Varnish will send frequent requests
to ``/healthcheck``. As long as the server responds with ``200 OK`` within
the standard time frame, traffic will go as normal. If it stops responding,
or doesn't respond with ``200 OK``, then Varnish will not send traffic to
it at all, except health checks.

You can also provide more details for the probe.

.. code:: VCL

   backend foo {
           .host = "192.168.0.1";
           .probe = {
                   .request = "GET /healthcheck HTTP/1.1"
                              "Host: example.com";
                   .expected_response = 206;
                   .interval = 10s;
                   .threshold = 5;
                   .window = 15;
           }
   }

This probe definition uses a complete request instead of just a URL, which
can be useful if your health check needs some special headers for example.
It also overrides the expected response code, expecting 206 instead of 200.
None of the probe options are mandatory, however.

|                   |             | backend healthy.                          |
+-------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------+
| initial           | threshold-1 | When starting up, how polls in the window |
|                   |             | should be considered good. If set to 0,   |
|                   |             | the backend will not get any traffic until|
|                   |             | Varnish has probed it "threshold" amount  |
|                   |             | of times.                                 |
+-------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------+

Window, threshold and initial are all related. The idea of a window is that
you might not want to disable a backend just because it fails a single
probe. With the default setting, Varnish will evaluate the last 8 probes
sent when checking if a backend is healthy. If at least 3 of them were OK,
then the backend is considered healthy.

One issue with this logic is that when Varnish starts up, there are no
health probes in the history at all. With only "window" and "threshold",
this would require Varnish to send at least 3 probes by default before it
starts sending traffic to a server. That would mean some considerable
downtime if you restarted your Varnish server.

To solve this problem, Varnish has the "initial" value. When there is no
history, Varnish will consider "initial" amount of health probes good. The
default value is relative to "threshold" in such a way that just a single
probe needs to be sent for Varnish to consider the backend healthy.

As you can imagine, if you have to define all these options for all your
backends, you end up with a lot of identical copy-pasted code blocks. This
can be avoided by using named probes instead.

.. code:: VCL

   probe myprobe {
           .url = "/healthcheck";
           .interval = 2s;
           .window = 5;
           .threshold = 2;
   }

   backend one {
           .host = "192.168.2.1";
           .probe = myprobe;
   }

Reviewing health probe status
.............................

There are a few different ways to review health state. Let's start with
``varnishlog``::

        # varnishlog -g raw -i Backend_health
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 8 3 8 0.000425 0.000562 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 8 3 8 0.000345 0.000508 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 8 3 8 0.000401 0.000481 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 8 3 8 0.000437 0.000470 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 8 3 8 0.000381 0.000448 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 8 3 8 0.000334 0.000419 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 8 3 8 0.000298 0.000389 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

This is fairly cryptic, but you get the general idea I suppose. Note the
``-g raw`` which is necessary because the ``Backend_health`` log-tag is not
part of a session, so grouping by session wouldn't work.

You'll see one line like this for each health probe sent.

A closer look at ``4--X-RH`` will tell you how the probe was handled. The
``4`` tells you it's IPv4, the ``X`` says it was sent OK, the ``R`` tells
you a response was read OK and the ``H`` says the health probe was
"healthy": The response was what we expected. In this case, a ``200 OK``.

You can get similar information from ``varnishadm``, in two different ways.
The first is the oldest way, and is "hidden"::

        # varnishadm

The ``debug.health`` command has been around for a long time, but was never
really intended for general use.

It does give you a history, though.

Let's see what happens if we disable our front page, which is what we're
probing::

        # chmod 000 /var/www/html/index.html 
        # varnishlog -g raw -i Backend_health
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-R- 6 3 8 0.000402 0.000408 HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-R- 5 3 8 0.000323 0.000408 HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-R- 4 3 8 0.000297 0.000408 HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-R- 3 3 8 0.000294 0.000408 HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
         0 Backend_health - default Went sick 4--X-R- 2 3 8 0.000407 0.000408 HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
         0 Backend_health - default Still sick 4--X-R- 1 3 8 0.000307 0.000408 HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
         0 Backend_health - default Still sick 4--X-R- 0 3 8 0.000385 0.000408 HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
         0 Backend_health - default Still sick 4--X-R- 0 3 8 0.000350 0.000408 HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
         0 Backend_health - default Still sick 4--X-R- 0 3 8 0.000290 0.000408 HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

First, observe that the ``4--X-RH`` tag has changed to ``4--X-R-`` instead.
This tells you that Varnish is still able to send the probe and it still
receives a valid HTTP response, but it isn't happy about it - it's not a
``200 OK``.

Further, look at the three next numbers. Further up they were ``8 3 8``.
Now they start out at ``6 3 8`` (because I was a bit slow to start the
varnishlog-command).

The first number is the number of good health probes in the window(6), the
next is the threshold(3) the last is the size of the window (8). For each
bad health probe, the number of good health probes we have go down by 1.
Once it breaches the threshold, Varnish reports that the backend "Went
sick". Up until that point, Varnish would still send traffic to that
backend. The number of good health probes goes all the way down to 0.

If we fix our backend, let's see the reverse happening::

        # chmod a+r /var/www/html/index.html ; varnishlog -g raw -i Backend_health
         0 Backend_health - default Still sick 4--X-RH 1 3 8 0.000365 0.000398 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still sick 4--X-RH 2 3 8 0.000330 0.000381 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Back healthy 4--X-RH 3 3 8 0.000329 0.000368 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 4 3 8 0.000362 0.000366 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 5 3 8 0.000327 0.000357 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 6 3 8 0.000366 0.000359 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 7 3 8 0.000332 0.000352 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 8 3 8 0.000358 0.000354 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         0 Backend_health - default Still healthy 4--X-RH 8 3 8 0.000295 0.000339 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Even though our backend starts behaving well immediately, Varnish will
consider it "sick" until it has reached the threshold for number of health
probes needed.

The other numbers in the log output are timing for sending and receiving
the response.

The threshold and window-mechanism is there to avoid "flapping". But it is
far from perfect.

.. warning::

   You generally do not want to use the debug-commands unless you really
   know what you are doing.  Things such as ``debug.panic.master`` will
   kill Varnish (by design), and is included exclusively for development,
   QA and testing. Similarilly, ``debug.srandom`` will let you forcibly
   set the "random seed", of Varnish, making the random numbers
   predictable. Useful for unit-tests, horrible for production.

.. FIXME: Need to update this for varnish 4.1 and include other states than
   the usual suspects.

Forcing state
.............

You can forcibly set the state of a backend to sick if you want to remove
it from rotation. This is easily done with varnishadm::

        # varnishadm backend.list
        Backend name                   Admin      Probe
        boot.default                   probe      Healthy 6/8

        # varnishadm backend.set_health boot.default sick
        # varnishadm backend.list
        Backend name                   Admin      Probe
        boot.default                   sick       Healthy 8/8

        # varnishadm backend.set_health boot.default healthy
        # varnishadm backend.list
        Backend name                   Admin      Probe
        boot.default                   healthy    Healthy 8/8

        # varnishadm backend.set_health boot.default probe
        # varnishadm backend.list
        Backend name                   Admin      Probe
        boot.default                   probe      Healthy 8/8

In the above example we first list the backends. The naming scheme is
``<vcl>.<name>``. The "Admin" column lists the administrative state. It
starts out as "probe" - use whatever the probe state is. The next column is
the probe state itself. In the beginning you see that the probe is
considering the backend healthy, with 6 out of 8 healthy probes (Varnish
was just restarted).

We can use ``backend.set_health <name> <state>`` to modify the state. The
states available are ``healthy``, ``sick`` and ``probe``.

Alternatively, let's set up an incorrect health probe, by using a bogus ``.url`` in the VCL::

As you can see, Varnish starts out failing, because it believes the backend
to be down. Once we forcibly set it to healthy, then everything works, even
if ``backend.list`` still reveals that the health checks are failing.

Using ``backend.set_health`` is mainly meant to help you take things out of
production temporarily. Specially when you put backends back into
production, it is important to remember that you want to use
``backend.set_health <name> probe``, not ``backend.set_health <name>
healthy``. The latter will essentially make your probes worthless.


Load balancing
--------------

Varnish has always offered a few different ways to provide load balancing
of backends. With Varnish 4, this is done through varnish modules. Mostly
through the `directors` vmod, though any vmod can offer it.

The idea is simple enough: Provide multiple backends that share the load of
a single application.

In varnish, a load balancing scheme is usually referred to as a backend
director, or just a director.

Basic round-robin and random load balancing
...........................................

Round-robin load balancing will rotate which backend is used. At the end of
the day, all backends will have received the same amount of requests.

The random-director is almost just as simple. The traffic is randomly
distributed among the backends. At the end of the day, that means each
backend has received the same amount of requests.

The biggest difference between the two is that the random-director also
provides you with a means to adjust the `weight` of the distribution. You
can tell it to send more traffic to a more powerful backend than the rest,
for example.

.. code:: VCL

   import directors;

   backend one {
           .host = "192.168.2.1";
           .port = "80";
   }
   backend two {
           .host = "192.168.2.2";
           .port = "80";
   }
   sub vcl_init {
           new rrdirector = directors.round_robin();
           rrdirector.add_backend(one);
           rrdirector.add_backend(two);
   }

   sub vcl_recv {
           set req.backend_hint = rrdirector.backend();
   }

This example creates a director-object called `rrdirector`, of the
round-robin type. It then adds two backends to it.

In `vcl_recv`, we tell Varnish to use this director as backend.

You can do similar things with the random director.

.. code:: VCL

   import directors;

   backend one {
           .host = "192.168.2.1";
           .port = "80";
   }
   backend two {
           .host = "192.168.2.2";
           .port = "80";
   }
   sub vcl_init {
           new radirector = directors.random();
           radirector.add_backend(one, 5.0);
           radirector.add_backend(two, 1.0);
   }

   sub vcl_recv {
           set req.backend_hint = radirector.backend();
   }

Notice the second argument to `radirector.add_backend()`. This is the
relative weight. You can pick basically any scale you want, as long as it
is relative to the other backends. In this example, the backend called
`one` will get five times as much traffic as the one called `two`.

You can add any number of backends to the same director, and you can use
any number of directors.

Health probes and directors
...........................

Health probes and directors are meant for each other. If you have two or
more application servers that can serve the same site, putting them in a
single director and adding health probes to them allows you to ensure that
only known good backends are used.

This does offer some challenges, however. First of all, if you are doing
weighted load balancing, then the total weight will change. Let's assume
you have 5 backends:

+-----------+--------+
| Name      | Weight |
+===========+========+
| red       | 1      |
+-----------+--------+
| blue      | 2      |
+-----------+--------+
| orange    | 4      |
+-----------+--------+
| yellow    | 8      |
+-----------+--------+
| green     | 16     |
+-----------+--------+

Total weight would be 31. Normally, "green" will take 16/31, or 51% of the
traffic. The "yellow" backend will take half that, and so forth. If
"orange" suddenly went down, the new total weight would be 27. The extra
load would be distributed evenly: 16/27 would go to "green" (59%), 1/27
would go to "red" (3.7%).

Generally speaking, it is better to keep weighting more or less equal. It
makes it simpler for you to estimate load whenever you change your stack.

Dynamic use of directors
........................

Directors are dynamic, even if backends are not.

An example of this is that you can change the makeup of a director from
VCL:

.. code:: VCL

   import directors;

   backend one {
           .host = "192.168.2.1";
           .port = "80";
   }
   backend two {
           .host = "192.168.2.2";
           .port = "80";
   }
   sub vcl_init {
           new radirector = directors.random();
           radirector.add_backend(one, 5.0);
           radirector.add_backend(two, 1.0);
   }
   
   acl admins {
           "192.168.0.0"/24;
   }

   sub vcl_recv {
           set req.backend_hint = radirector.backend();
           if (req.url ~ "^/admin" && client.ip ~ admins) {
                   if (req.url ~ "/add_one") {
                           radirector.add_backend(one, 1.0);
                   }
                   if (req.url ~ "/remove_one") {
                           radirector.remove_backend(one);
                   }
                   if (req.url ~ "/add_two") {
                           radirector.add_backend(two, 1.0);
                   }
                   if (req.url ~ "/remove_one") {
                           radirector.remove_backend(two);
                   }
                   return (synth(200));
           }
   }

The above VCL allows someone in the IP range 192.168.0.0/24 to issues HTTP
requests to ``/admin/add_one``, ``/admin/remove_one``, ``/admin/add_two``
or ``/admin/remove_two`` to affect the load balancing. This is not very
common, but sensible use-cases for it could be automatic deployment, where
a script first removes a backend from the director, then upgrades it, then
puts it back in production. This, however, can also be achieved with
``backend.set_health``.

Fallback director
.................

The fallback director is a simple thing. You can add any number of backends
to it, but it will always give you the first one that is healthy.

The idea is that you have a primary backend that should always be used, but
if that fails, you can potentially serve alternate content from a different
backend.

.. code:: VCL

   import directors;

   probe myprobe { .url = "/"; }
   backend primary {
           .host = "192.168.0.1";
           .probe = myprobe;
   }

   backend secondary {
           .host = "127.0.0.1";
           .port = "8080";
           .probe = myprobe;
   }

   sub vcl_init {
        new fbdirector = directors.fallback();
        fbdirector.add_backend(primary);
        fbdirector.add_backend(secondary);
   }

   sub vcl_recv {
        set req.backend_hint = fbdirector.backend();
   }

You can have any number of backends in a fallback director.

Stacking directors
..................

Varnish treats all backends as directors, and vice versa. Wherever you can
add a backend, you can add a director.

As a result, you can add a director to another director. Most of the time,
this makes little sense.

The one situation where it makes a ton of sense, however, is when you
combine it with the fallback director.

Let's say you have 2 regular application servers, but also periodically
generate a static version of your site (or parts of it), that you put on a
simple web server in case your application goes down.

You can use a regular director for the first backends, but there are two
ways to use the second backend. One is simple VCL, using ``std.healthy``:

.. code:: VCL

   import directors;
   import std;

   probe myprobe { .url = "/"; }
   backend primary {
           .host = "192.168.0.1";
           .probe = myprobe;
   }

   backend secondary {
           .host = "192.168.0.2";
           .probe = myprobe;
   }

   backend fallback {
           .host = "127.0.0.1";
           .port = "8080";
           .probe = myprobe;
   }

   sub vcl_init {
        new rrdirector = directors.round_robin();
        rrdirector.add_backend(primary);
        rrdirector.add_backend(secondary);
   }

   sub vcl_recv {
        if (std.healthy(rrdirector.backend())) {
                set req.backend_hint = rrdirector.backend();
        } else {
                set req.backend_hint = fallback;
        }
   }

This works, but can easily clutter your VCL.

An alternative implementation using nested directors can be written as
such:

.. code:: VCL

   import directors;

   probe myprobe { .url = "/"; }

   backend primary {
           .host = "192.168.0.1";
           .probe = myprobe;
   }

   backend secondary {
           .host = "192.168.0.2";
           .probe = myprobe;
   }

   backend fallback {
           .host = "127.0.0.1";
           .port = "8080";
           .probe = myprobe;
   }

   sub vcl_init {
        new rrdirector = directors.round_robin();
        rrdirector.add_backend(primary);
        rrdirector.add_backend(secondary);
   
        new fbdirector = directors.fallback();
        fbdirector.add_backend(rrdirector.backend());
        fbdirector.add_backend(fallback);
   }

   sub vcl_recv {
        set req.backend_hint = fbdirector.backend();
   }

In this example, the end-result is the same, but all backend-logic is done
before you start working with `vcl_recv`.

Other examples where this is useful is if you have a set of application
servers and a set of servers for static content, but the static content is
*also* present on the application servers. You might want to have a
director for the static-only servers and a separate one for application
servers. Then a director for the combined result can be used for static
resources:

.. code:: VCL

   import directors;

   probe myprobe { .url = "/health"; }

   backend app1 { .host = "192.168.0.1"; .probe = myprobe; }
   backend app2 { .host = "192.168.0.2"; .probe = myprobe; }
   backend app3 { .host = "192.168.0.3"; .probe = myprobe; }
   backend app4 { .host = "192.168.0.4"; .probe = myprobe; }
   backend app5 { .host = "192.168.0.5"; .probe = myprobe; }

   backend static1 { .host = "192.168.1.1"; .probe = myprobe; }
   backend static2 { .host = "192.168.1.2"; .probe = myprobe; }
   backend static3 { .host = "192.168.1.3"; .probe = myprobe; }
   backend static4 { .host = "192.168.1.4"; .probe = myprobe; }

   sub vcl_init {
        new appservers = directors.round_robin();
        appservers.add_backend(app1);
        appservers.add_backend(app2);
        appservers.add_backend(app3);
        appservers.add_backend(app4);
        appservers.add_backend(app5);

        new staticonly = directors.round_robin();
        staticonly.add_backend(static1);
        staticonly.add_backend(static2);
        staticonly.add_backend(static3);
        staticonly.add_backend(static4);

        new static = directors.fallback();
        static.add_backend(staticonly.backend());
        static.add_backend(appservers.backend());

   }

   sub vcl_recv {
           if (req.url ~ "^/static") {
                   set req.backend_hint = static.backend();
           } else {
                   set req.backend_hint = appservers.backend();
           }
   }

In the above scenario, you have three directors:

* ``appservers`` are only the application servers, and is used by default.
* ``staticonly`` are the servers that only has static content.
* ``static`` is the set of the above - all servers that could deliver
  static content.

By writing your VCL like this, you separate the load balancing from the
actual routing of traffic. In `vcl_recv`, you just say "this is static
content, fetch it from a server that has static files". If you later wanted
to change the balancing so that the application servers got traffic for
static content even if a static-only server was up, then you could make
that change in `vcl_init` without having to adjust `vcl_recv` at all.
